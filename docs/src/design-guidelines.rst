Buttons
=======

In our project we use three types of buttons:

* Primary buttons (css class ``btn``):
  The main call to action on the page, e.g. submitting a form or opening another page
* Outline buttons (css classes ``btn btn-outline``):
  The secondary call to action on the page, e.g. submitting a form as draft
* Ghost buttons (css classes ``btn btn-ghost``):
  Buttons that don't trigger an immediate action, but only hide/show additional components, e.g. filters or previews.
